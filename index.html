<h1>My favorite aminal</h1>


<p>My favorite animal is the dog. They are my favorite animals because they are some of the most loyal animals in the world. They are also extremely smart and can be trained to rescue people out of fallen buildings when an earthquake happens. They can also be trained to assist people with disabilities as well as the elderly. Some (bigger) dogs can also be trained for protection, as well as for malicious purposes like dog fighting. Some are also trained for law enforcement, they have a super sharp sense of smell so they're able to smell drugs and even explosives!</p>

<p>
	Dogs are also the best companions because they are always happy to see you. After a long day at work, when you come home, there's nobody in your house that will be happier to see you than your dog. There are dozens of breeds but my favorite is the Jack Russel Terrier mix. I love these dogs because they're extremely active and energetic. They can spend the entire afternoon running around in the park for no reason whatsoever. They're great dogs to have if you're into running. You will get tired faster than they will.
